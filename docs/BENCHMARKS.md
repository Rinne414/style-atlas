# Benchmarks

All numbers come from `style-atlas bench`, run on real data. When the encoder, the
preprocessing or a default changes, re-run the benchmark and update this file in the same commit.

`bench` first reduces near-duplicates to one image each (see `duplicates`). Copies, crops and
frames of one scene otherwise find each other and inflate retrieval scores.

## Danbooru artists (2026-10-09)

- **Data**: 3,253 general-rated Danbooru works by 306 artists (median 12 each), 512 px
  thumbnails. Posts with minor or multi-panel tags were excluded when the corpus was collected.
- **Deduplication**: 308 near-duplicates were removed, leaving 2,941 images by 296 artists.
- **Labels**: the artist. One artist's works vary in character, scene and period, so the label
  means "who drew it", not "one fixed style". That makes this a hard test.
- **Encoder**: CSD ViT-L at 224 px with a centre crop. Its vectors match the reference CSD
  implementation (cosine 1.0000).
- **Command**: `style-atlas bench <thumbs> --labels prefix --trials 60`.

| Score | Raw cosine | Hub-corrected (CSLS, k=10) |
|---|---|---|
| Top-1 nearest neighbour, same artist | 44.6% | **46.2%** |
| Top-5 | 61.2% | **64.2%** |
| Top-10 | 67.5% | **70.4%** |
| Same-artist pair AUC | 0.780 | **0.831** |

Chance at top-1 is about 0.3%. Before deduplication the same run gave top-1 54.5% and AUC 0.845.
That gap is how much the duplicates inflated the score.

### Blind mixture clustering: the LoRA case

Each trial draws 2, 3 or 5 random artists, each with at least 5 works, and mixes their works
into one set. The set is clustered without the number of artists being given. The score is the
adjusted Rand index (ARI) against the artist labels, averaged over 60 draws: 1 is perfect,
0 is chance.

| Granularity (threshold) | 2 artists | 3 artists | 5 artists |
|---|---|---|---|
| fine (0.40) | 0.42 | 0.34 | 0.39 |
| **medium (0.47, default)** | **0.51** | **0.50** | **0.47** |
| coarse (0.55) | 0.44 | 0.39 | 0.32 |

**Distance (development run, 90 draws, before deduplication):**

| Distance | ARI at threshold 0.45 (2 / 3 / 5 artists) |
|---|---|
| Raw cosine | 0.48 / 0.48 / 0.47 |
| Hub-corrected | 0.50 / 0.46 / 0.56 |

**True number of artists given.** ARI was 0.59 / 0.55 / 0.53 with hub correction and only
0.22 / 0.28 / 0.27 without. Average linkage on raw cosine collapses into one giant cluster plus
singletons, and hub correction removes most of that failure.

**Full 300-artist set, true count given (k=300):**

| Method | NMI | ARI |
|---|---|---|
| Average linkage, raw cosine | 0.55 | 0.02 |
| Average linkage, hub-corrected | 0.70 | 0.17 |
| HDBSCAN (PCA-64), non-noise points only | 0.87 | 0.49 |

HDBSCAN left 49% of points as noise.

## Pixiv: followed AI-illustration accounts (2026-10-09)

- **Data**: 467 all-ages works by 176 AI-illustration accounts (median 2 works each). The
  vectors came from the research pipeline.
- **Labels**: the account.
- **Mixtures**: too few works per account for the mixture test.

| Score | Raw cosine | Hub-corrected |
|---|---|---|
| Top-1 | 17.1% | **19.1%** |
| Top-10 | 45.4% | **48.6%** |
| Pair AUC | 0.745 | **0.799** |

Hub correction helps on AI illustration as much as on human artwork.

## Tried and rejected

### Subtracting the CSD content head (2026-10-09)

CSD outputs a style vector and a content vector. On the Danbooru corpus the two heads carry
almost the same information, so subtracting content buys almost nothing:

- Their pairwise similarities correlate at 0.95.
- Content vectors find the same artist as often as style vectors do (top-10 74.7% vs 74.7%,
  before deduplication).

The approaches tried:

- **Regressing content out of style** (ridge, then the residual): top-10 rose 74.7 to 76.0%
  and AUC 0.844 to 0.867, but clustering at the tuned thresholds collapsed (ARI 0.5 to 0.2).
  That scale change would need new thresholds for a gain of about 1 point.
- **Subtracting content similarity** (`hub(S) - b * hub(C)`): slightly worse at every b tried.

Not adopted. The content vectors are still used, for near-duplicate detection.

## Demo: 3 artists, 10 works each

```
style-atlas cluster demo3 --export copy
-> 4 styles, 0 unassigned
   abubu  10 -> style_01
   dayama 10 -> style_02
   inoino  7 -> style_03, 3 -> style_04   (the 3 are copies of one picture)
```
